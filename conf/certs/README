The certs/ directory contains the TLS certificates required for encrypting
client to server XMPP connections. TLS encryption is mandatory for these streams
so this directory must be configured properly.

The ca-bundle.crt file contains root Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
These are used to validate certificates presented during TLS handshake
negotiation. The source for this file is the cacert.pem file available
at http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html.

Any self-signed CA certificate placed in this directory will be considered
a trusted certificate. For example, let's say you're running the wonderland.lit
XMPP server and haven't purchased a legitimate TLS certificate from a CA known
in ca-bundle.crt. Instead, you've created a self-signed certificate named
wonderland.lit.crt. Place the certificate in this directory and it will be
trusted. TLS connections from the agent to wonderland.lit will now work.
